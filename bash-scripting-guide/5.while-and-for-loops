while loop:

while [CONDITION]
do
	# Code executed while condition is true.
done

---

for loop:

for (( i=x; i<y; i++ ))
do
	# Code to be executed while value of i is less than y
done

---

for loop with seq:

for variableName in $(seq x y)
do 
	# Code to be executed.
done

- Simpler syntax.
- variableName istantiated in the for loop.
- variableName begins with value x and completes last iteration with value y.
