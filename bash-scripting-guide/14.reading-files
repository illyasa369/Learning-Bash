Reading file content:


fileName="/path/to/file.txt"

while IFS= read -r line
do
	echo "$line"
done < "$fileName"


- IFS= ensures whitespaces are not trimmed, the line is read as-is.
- read -r line does not interpret / as escape characters.
- Parsed data stored in variable line.

fileName="/path/to/file.txt"

cat "$fileName" | while IFS= read -r line; do
        echo "$line"
done
