Set command:

Used to modify shell behaviour.

set -e : Instructs the script to exit immediately if a command exits with non-zero code.
set -u : Treats unset variables as error and exits the script.
set -x : Prints each command before executing it allowing you to trace what commands are 
	 running and in what order.


By default, only the exit status of the final command in a pipeline is returned. This can hide errors in earlier commands.

set -o pipefail : Entire pipeline fails if any command fails. Also returns the first failing command in the pipeline.


set -euxo pipeline : Allows you to utilize all the above together making scripts more robust and easier to debug.
