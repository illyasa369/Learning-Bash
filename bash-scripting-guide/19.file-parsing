File parsing with IFS:

IFS is an Internal Field Seperator which seperates fields based on the character specified.

---

Without field splitting:

while IFS= read -r lines
do
	# Code
done < file.txt

- Disables field splitting and parses entire lines using file.txt which is redirected to the loop.

---

With field splitting:

while IFS='=' read -r key value
do 
        # Code 
done < file.txt

- Parses the lines at the = sign storing the fields before and after = in key and value.
